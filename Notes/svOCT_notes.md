## svOCT Setup

### Purpose

   We would like to visualize the small cortical arteries in a kidney. The use of OCT has been tested in two kidneys, and we were able to see _some_ of the vascular structures present in the kidney. However, it is very diffucult to differentiate tubular and vascular structures while using "regular" OCT. So, we will test speckle variance OCT (svOCT) instead.
   
### Methods

  svOCT requires blood flow so that some speckle variation occurs inside the vessels so we can see them. There are two options for achieving this:
  1. Prepare an anesthetized rat and mount the kidney _in vivo_ under the OCT scope.
  2. Perfuse a fixed kidney _ex vivo_ to see if the svOCT setting even works for our purposes.
  
We will perfuse a kidney using Intralipid (Invitrogen I141), because Liposyn is not available easily (requires a prescription). Liposyn is an emulsion of sunflower and soybean oils whereas Intralipid is an emulsion of soybean oil. Multiple groups have performed svOCT using flow phantoms perfused with Intralipid.
